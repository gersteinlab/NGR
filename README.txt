All code is on GitHub.

All data suffiecient to run the code is on Farnam. In other words, Farnam is sufficient to reproduce all results.

More data/analyses might be found locally (e.g. gene_gene_matrix for more pathway databases than selected one (KEGG))

Feature extraction is done within each subfolder. Each subfolder has its code/ directory and README file to explain specific feature extraction steps.
